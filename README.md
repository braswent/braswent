- 👋 Hi, I’m @braswent

- What I have done:
  - I have built applications that allow user's to custoize a mlOps pipeline for their data.
  - I have built many web pages related to getting data scientists to access cloud applications.
  - If it is challenging and has a purpose I find interesting, I am usually all ears!
